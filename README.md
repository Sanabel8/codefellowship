* Build an app that allows users to create their profile on CodeFellowship.
The site should have :
 * splash page at the root route (/)
 * ApplicationUser should have a username, password (will be hashed using BCrypt), firstName, lastName, dateOfBirth, bio
 * allow users to create an ApplicationUser on the “sign up”
 * Your Controller should have an @Autowired private PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder; and use that to run passwordEncoder.encode(password)
 * ApplicationUser, at a route like /users/{id}.
This should include a default profile picture, which is the same for every user, and their basic information.
* Add a Post entity to your app.
A Post has a body and a createdAt timestamp.
